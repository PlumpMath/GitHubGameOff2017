## Installing and running the game

For the client, Phaser is included in the code (`js/phaser.min.js`). You will need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the Node.js packages required for the server. To run the server, you'll need to have Node.js installed.

Clone the repository. Inside the newly created directory, run `npm install` to install the Node.js packages listed in `package.json`. Then run `node app.js` to start the server. The server will listen to connections on port `3000`; you can change that behaviour by editing the code. You can access the app by navigating to http://localhost:3000/.

## How i worked on it

<ul>
<li>I've taken the basical example found on GITHUB <a href="https://github.com/albator95/phaser-easystar"> here </a> </li>

<li>I've found the free character animation on https://gumroad.com/mnrart really interesting for a basic animation so i started to use it </li>
